# Module 17. Unsupervised Machine Learning and Cryptocurrencies


## Overview 

The purpose of this challenge is to apply skills related with Machine Learning, specifically some topics related with unsupervised learning like what it is “used for, how to process data, how to cluster, how to reduce your dimensions, and how to reduce the principal components using PCA”.

The goal of this project is create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system in order to know what is the best option to offer a new cryptocurrency investment portfolio for a financial company customers because this company does not have any information and expertise on cryptocurrencies market.

## Results. Deliverables

In order to reach this goal, four deliverables are included 

•	Deliverable 1: Preprocessing the Data for PCA
•	Deliverable 2: Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
•	Deliverable 3: Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
•	Deliverable 4: Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results
